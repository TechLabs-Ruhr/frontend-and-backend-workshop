# FastAPI API Demo - Contacts

This repository demonstrates a simple API built with Express for managing contacts. The API serves sample contact data and provides endpoints for retrieving, adding, and deleting contacts. The latter endpoints are provided as skeletons (returning a 501 error) so it's up to you to implement the actual functionality.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the API

```bash
npm run start
```

3. Open the app

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.
