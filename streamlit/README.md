# Streamlit Demo - Contacts

This repository demonstrates a simple app built with Streamlit for managing contacts. The app displays contacts in a table along with a histogram showing the number of contacts per age bucket. Additionally, the app includes a form for adding a new contact and a button for deleting a contact but the implementation of these features is not provided, so it's up to you to implement them.
